You told us what you wanted and we listened! Our first release of 2017 supercharges the Socket Toolkit with new tools for budgeting, borrowing capacity and commission calculations, and a professional PDF generation feature.

<br>
Take the beta version of the toolkit for a spin at <a href='http://toolkit.socket.co.nz/beta'>http://toolkit.socket.co.nz/beta</a>

We have a variety of affordable subscription options coming early next month, along with enhancements to the rest of the Socket suite. Watch this space!
