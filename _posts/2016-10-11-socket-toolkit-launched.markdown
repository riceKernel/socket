Following the successful release of the socket CRM and application tool, we are now proud to launch the first three tools in the Socket Toolkit (beta), with open access to anyone wanting to take them for a spin.
<br>
We plan to develop the Socket Toolkit into a broad range of calculators and tools for mortgage advisers, lending professionals, and mortgage customers.
<br>
The tools in the current beta include:
The Socket Payment Calculator: A simple and easy to use loan repayment calculator that works on any device
The Socket Loan Planner: A sophisticated loan modeling and life-event tool (designed for tablet, laptop and desktop)
The Socket Offer Comparison Tool: An intelligent comparison tool for comparing multiple offers from lenders

These market-leading tools are designed to be user-friendly, intuitive and to offer an additional point of difference for your business.
<br>
We welcome any feedback on the current tools as well as suggestions for new tools to be developed.
We look forward to adding more tools to the toolkit over the coming month - watch this space!
